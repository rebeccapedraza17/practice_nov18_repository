# Write a function called in1020(a,b)
# The function takes two numbers
# And returns True if either number is between 10 and 20 (inclusive)
# And returns to False otherwise

def in1020(a,b):
    pass
    if a <= 10  <= 20:
        return True
    if b <= 10 <= 20:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Write a function called not_string(str)
# That returns a string that has not in front of the original
# Unless not is alredy there, in case that case return string as is

def not_string(str):
    pass

# Bonus function
# Not not_string, as above, but if not is there, removes it
